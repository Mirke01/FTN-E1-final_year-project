The project aims to design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that recognizes 50 different types of logos using Python, and then implement the Convolution2D with pipeline(of 4 phases) module in RTL (Register-Transfer Level) using VHDL, along with an AXI-Lite controller. The project also involves functional verification of the IP using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) and development of Linux drivers for the IP.
